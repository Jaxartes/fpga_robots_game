This file is the README document for "fpga_robots_game."

"fpga_robots_game" is an implementation of the classic computer game
"robots" in digital logic, intended to be run on an FPGA.

The game was designed for and tested on the Papilio Pro board, with
the Papilio Arcade board attached to it.  But it ought to be portable
to other FPGA boards that have the right things on them.

See "fpga_robots_game.txt" for documentation.
