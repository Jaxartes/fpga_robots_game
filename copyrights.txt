notes on copyright holders for "fpga_robots_game"

in my current tile set I've got text images derived from:
    "FreeSerif" for the "Robots!" title
    "8x16" for numbers and field headers
        Copyright 1987, 1988, 1989 Sony Corp.
        I don't know of an English language name for this font.
        It's long been used in X11.
        where another name for it is:
        -Sony-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--16-120-100-100-C-80-ISO8859-1
